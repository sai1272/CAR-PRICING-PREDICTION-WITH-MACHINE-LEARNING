# CAR-PRICING-PREDICTION-WITH-MACHINE-LEARNING


This project involves predicting the price of a car based on various features, such as brand goodwill, car features, horsepower, mileage, and more. The price prediction of cars is a major research area in machine learning, where we can apply regression models to estimate the price based on input features.

### Problem Description
The price of a car is influenced by a variety of factors such as:
- Car brand reputation
- Car features (e.g., safety, comfort, technology)
- Engine horsepower
- Fuel efficiency (mileage)
- Age of the car
- Location, and many others

By analyzing historical car data and training a machine learning model, we aim to predict the price of a car given its attributes. This project provides a good foundation for understanding regression techniques and feature engineering in the context of machine learning.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about cars, including:
- **Brand**: The car manufacturer or model
- **Model year**: The manufacturing year of the car
- **Mileage**: The distance the car has been driven
- **Engine horsepower**: The power of the car's engine
- **Fuel type**: Whether the car uses petrol, diesel, electric, etc.
- **Car features**: Additional features (e.g., air conditioning, sunroof, etc.)
- **Location**: The region where the car is sold
- **Price**: The target variable representing the price of the car

You can use publicly available car datasets like [Kaggleâ€™s Car Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection**: Obtain a dataset of cars with features and corresponding prices.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset (handle missing values, convert categorical variables, scale numerical features, etc.).
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features that improve model performance, such as encoding car brands or normalizing mileage.
4. **Model Training**: Train different machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict the car price.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the price of new cars based on their features.

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`
